# Analytics_Reflector

## Introduction
This project is created to reflect the metadata of HTTP requests to websites as well as basic javascript functionalities in a browser. While to many developers these are more or less fundamentals of web programming, the information that a web service is able to collect and analyze is less clear for the vast majority of web users. This project contains completely local javascript code and send no web requests except one call to IPdata to acquire client IP.  This project is meant for educational and demonstrative purposes only. Below are three main aspects this site provides the user. 

### UserAgent
This is to show the user that their operating system and their browser version may be detected by the website and collected for variosu purposes.

### Network
This part is to show the user that an HTTP request shows their ip address, which ties to a rough geolocation. 

### Browsing
This part is to show the user the ability for websites to track mouse movements and clicks, which could reflect browsing preferences and other aspects of the user. 

### Hosting
This website is hosted at analytics.danielhou.me until the end of 2022. Since this is a limited-resource server, no future hosting plan is yet determined.
